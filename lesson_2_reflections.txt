1> What happens when you initialize a repository? Why 
do you need to do it?

Init creates a .git file which stores the meta 
data detailing the changes made in each commit. 
Init needs to be done in order to make the directory
a repository.

2> How is the staging area different from the working 
directory and the repository? What value do you think 
it offers?

The staging area holds the records to be passed into
the next commit. This is the middle stage between 
the working directory (directory where the repository
resides) and the repository. This allows the user
more control over how and when things are added to
the repository.
