1> When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If there are multiple people working on the same project or if you wanted to share your 
work.

2> Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 
Remote repository may contain files or changes that conflict with the changes 
you have made. These may need to be resolved in a merge.

3> Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of the other?

A branch is a split in a single repository. A clone is a copy of a remote repository. A fork is a copy of a GitHub repository
into another GitHub repository. You might use a fork instead of cloning if you wanted to use another user's repository
but do not have permission or the desire to change that user's repository.
