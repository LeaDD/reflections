1> When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If there are multiple people working on the same project or if you wanted to share your 
work.

2> Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 
Remote repository may contain files or changes that conflict with the changes 
you have made. These may need to be resolved in a merge.
